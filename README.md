# Cute Anime Girls (Vencord)

A Vencord plugin to do `/anime-girls ?cat:bool`, and send a random cute anime girl from reddit.

## All code seen in `index.ts` belongs to ShadiestGoat's Cute Anime Boys Plugin: https://github.com/ShadiestGoat/vencord-cuteanimeboys
I modified only a few lines to make it where it sends anime girls instead.


I might create my own vencord plugin in the future. Who knows maybe its something useful or just for fun.
